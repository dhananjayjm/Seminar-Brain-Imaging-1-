A modern cytoarchitectonic atlas seeks to accomplish this in several dimensions while taking individual variations into account. Accurately mapping the brain regions is one of the fundamental goals of neuroscience. By fine-tuning existing brain boundaries based on cellular structure, Amunts, and colleagues created an atlas utilizing a series of histological brain sections and computational techniques. They can modify their methodology to produce maps of the brains of various species or of other organs. They established a methodology for future study, making it both replicable and flexible.
 
Cytoarchitecture is a study to divide the brain into different regions based on microscopic structure. The Julich-Brain atlas maps these regions in 3D and takes into account individual differences by being probabilistic. Construction of this atlas required complex procedures for data collection and processing. The atlas is continuously updated, openly accessible, and can be integrated with other brain mapping resources.
